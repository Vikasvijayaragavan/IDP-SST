    <p style="text-align: center;">A speech by jawaharlal nehru after we got freedom</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">It is called "TRYST WITH DESTINY"</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">It is a speech delivered by Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of independent India, to the Indian Constituent Assembly in The Parliament, on the eve of India's Independence,
         towards midnight on 14 August 1947. It focuses on the aspects that transcend India's history and the birth of a new nation.</p>


    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: large;" >"At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom."

            "A moment comes, which comes but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new, when an age ends, and when the soul of a nation, long suppressed, finds utterance.
         It is fitting that at this solemn moment we take the pledge of dedication to the service of India and her people and to the greatness of her culture."
        
        "The service of India means the service of the millions who suffer. It means the ending of poverty and ignorance and disease and inequality of opportunity. The ambition of the greatest man of our generation has been to wipe every tear from every eye.
         That may be beyond us, but as long as there are tears and suffering, so long our work will not be over."
